    "description": "Padlock works to prevent unexpected code execution when dealing with asynchronous callbacks without blocking. Call a function with lock to execute it as soon as a lock can be attained, and unlock it at all of your possible callback end-points. Use the same lock on other functions that you don't want to interrupt. Code will execute in order as the lock can be acquired.",
