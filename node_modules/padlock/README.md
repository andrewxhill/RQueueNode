# Padlock

Padlock is not a synchronous library. Padlock is not blocking.

Padlock works to selectively prevent conflicting/interrupting code execution when dealing with asynchronous callbacks. Call a function with lock to execute it as soon as a lock can be attained, and unlock it at all of your possible callback end-points. Use the same lock on other functions that you don't want to interrupt, and leave functions that you don't mind interrupting your lock alone. Locked functions will execute in order as the lock can be acquired when the lock is released.

## Why

I wrote this to deal with node_redis in the `WATCH -> GET -> MULTI ... values using the GET ... EXEC` scenario. I repeatedly had issues with other functions happening between the `WATCH` and the `MULTI` that would send commands and interrupt my `WATCH`. I confirmed with the author that this is a known issue he plans on solving. In the meantime, I wrote this to use in any function with a `WATCH` will lock and unlock in the `EXEC` callback. I'm sure you could use this anywhere you need to keep certain conflicting functions out of specific callback chains.

Could I have done this with an asynchronous library? Maybe, but I find that using that approach removes the advantages of an event-queue language.

**The biggest advantage is that functions that do not use your lock will be uninterrupted by your locked callback.** That is, you may have a lot of events and functions executing during your lock, but so long as you use your lock selectively, node.js will not wait on your lock release to run unrelated code. This is significantly different to some (maybe all?) of the synchronous libs from node.js, and should keep your service running very quickly dispite waiting on callbacks semi-synchronously.


##Install

    npm install padlock

## Methods
`lockid = Padlock.acquire(callback, args, ctx, timeout)` (ctx & timeout optional)
Acquire a lock or queue up a function. Will never not, but will queue callack
if lock is unsuccesful, unlike runwithlock().

`Padlock.runwithlock(callback, args, ctx, timeout)` (ctx & timeout optional)
Acquire a lock and run callback or queue up the callback on a failed lock. Will execute
callback if initial lock attempt is successful, unlike acquire.

`bool = Padlock.islocked()`
Check to see if the lock is currently acquired.

`Padlock.release(lockid)` (lockid is optional)
Undo the lock. Can be conditional on the current lock being lockid.

`Padock.require(callback, ctx, timeout)` (ctx & timeout optional)
Wrap a funcion call in a function that acquires a lock before running.

## Events

The Padlock instance is an EventEmitter. You can subscribe to events with `Padlock.on(...)`, `Padlock.once(...)` etc.

Here are the events (these all pass the lockid as an argument):  
`locked` -- sent when a lock is acquired.  
`unlocked` -- sent when a lock is released (warning, may not be unlocked by the time you get this event)  
`timeout` -- called when a lock hasn't been released in the timeout time. You may want to release the lock at this point using the lockid argument when calling `release`.

## Examples

### Out of Order
    var Padlock = require("padlock").Padlock;

    var lock = new Padlock();

    //a set of functions where one is asynchronous and could get out of order
    console.log("start");
    setTimeout(function() {
        console.log("middle");
    }, 200);
    console.log("end");

> start  
> end  
> middle  

### Ensuring Order
    lock.runwithlock(function () {
        console.log("start");
        lock.release();
    });
    lock.runwithlock(setTimeout, [function() {
        console.log("middle");
        lock.release();
    }, 200]);
    lock.runwithlock(function () {
        console.log("end");
        lock.release();
    });

>  start  
>  middle  
>  end  

### Replacing a Function with a Lock Requirement
    function logit(x) {
        console.log(x);
        lock.release();
    }

    logit = lock.require(logit);

    logit("a");
    lock.acquire(setTimeout, [function() {
        console.log("b");
        lock.release();
    }, 200]);
    logit("c");

    logit("the end!");

> a  
> b  
> c  
> the end!
